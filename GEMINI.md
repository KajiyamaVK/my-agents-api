# Gemini Instructions

This file contains instructions for the Gemini CLI agent to follow when working on this project.

## Deployment

To redeploy the application, use the `deploy` script from `package.json`:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Instructions

The user can edit this file to add or change instructions for the Gemini CLI agent.

- **Update Documentation**: Every time we add, remove, or update API endpoints or features, update `README.md` with detailed usage instructions.
- **Bruno Configuration**: Bruno configuration must be kept in sync with actual API endpoints. If endpoints change, update existing Bruno requests or create new ones immediately.

## Vibe Coding & TDD Workflow

We follow "Vibe Coding" principles where the AI acts as an Orchestrator and TDD is the safety net.

### The Workflow
1. **Define Intent (The Blueprint)**
   - Define the interface or requirement first. Do not jump to code.
   - Example: "Define a TypeScript interface for a service that handles..."

2. **Generate Tests First (The Contract)**
   - Write or update a complete test suite defining the expected behavior.
   - Do NOT implement the service yet (or if backfilling, verify behavior).
   - The test suite is the "Contract" that defines success.

3. **The Red-to-Green "Vibe"**
   - Run the tests. Failures reveal the gap.
   - Implement the service/controller to make these specific tests pass.
   - Do not write bloat; only fulfill the contract.

4. **Shadow Technical Debt Prevention**
   - Always check for existing tests before searching for files.
   - Never skip tests for speed.
