These are the MQTT messages generated by Frigate. The default topic\_prefix is `frigate`, but can be changed in the config file.

## General Frigate Topics[​](#general-frigate-topics "Direct link to General Frigate Topics")

### `frigate/available`[​](#frigateavailable "Direct link to frigateavailable")

Designed to be used as an availability topic with Home Assistant. Possible message are: "online": published when Frigate is running (on startup) "offline": published after Frigate has stopped

### `frigate/restart`[​](#frigaterestart "Direct link to frigaterestart")

Causes Frigate to exit. Docker should be configured to automatically restart the container on exit.

### `frigate/events`[​](#frigateevents "Direct link to frigateevents")

Message published for each changed tracked object. The first message is published when the tracked object is no longer marked as a false\_positive. When Frigate finds a better snapshot of the tracked object or when a zone change occurs, it will publish a message with the same id. When the tracked object ends, a final message is published with `end_time` set.
