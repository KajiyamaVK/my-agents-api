# Stacked Diff

September 4, 2025

![Stacked Diff](/docs/_astro/changelog-017-fade.BsxUDclU_Z1eGKg5.webp)

To improve the code review experience, we’ve introduced a new stacked layout for the diff viewer. This change displays diffs for multiple files vertically on a single screen. The stacked view makes it easier to see related changes across your codebase at a glance, providing better context and speeding up your review process.

Changes:

*   The diff viewer now stacks file changes vertically by default
*   You can also toggle back to the previous tabbed diff viewer
