# Limits and Plans

# **Jules Plans**

[Section titled “Jules Plans”](#jules-plans)

Jules is available with different plans designed to meet your specific needs, from individual exploration to intensive, professional development. For our initial launch, paid plans are accessed through a Google One subscription.

**Note on Plan Availability**

Paid Jules plans are accessed via a Google AI Plans subscription, which is currently available only for individual Google Accounts (ending in @gmail.com).

We are actively working on providing upgrade paths for other user types. In the meantime, If you are a business power user and need more access to Jules, please fill out [this interest form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeYzhMjUyHoLlIYl83cAjdaBCjsxzlx1vzIkgYwU9AvB_wm9A/viewform?usp=dialog) and we will get back to you.

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

[Section titled “Frequently Asked Questions”](#frequently-asked-questions)

**Why are paid plans only available for @gmail.com accounts right now?**

For our initial launch, we are launching in the Google AI Plans, which currently serves individual Google Accounts. We are working to quickly support other upgrade paths for users who have enterprise or Workspace accounts.

**Will the features and limits in these plans change over time?**

We may adjust limits and features as we learn how people are using the product. Our goal is to continue adding value, especially to the Pro and Ultra tiers, with differentiators like access to more advanced models, queue prioritization, more planned for the future.

**If my Google One plan is shared with my family, are my Jules task limits shared?**

For this launch, task limits are not shared or pooled. Each member of a shared family plan is treated as an individual user with their own set of task limits.

**What happens if I use all my tasks for the day?**

Once you reach your daily task limit (rolling 24 hour window), you will not be able to trigger new tasks until the limit resets. When you are at your limit, you may see calls to action within the product prompting you to upgrade to a higher plan.

**I have a Google AI plan, but I can’t access Jules. Why?**

Jules has a stricter age requirement than some Google One plans. To use Jules, you must be 18 years of age or older. Therefore, some members of a Google One plan who are under 18 may not have access to Jules benefits, even if the plan itself is active

**Can I still access my tasks when I hit a limit?**

When you hit a limit:

*   The **new task** button will be disabled
*   A tooltip or error message will explain the reason
*   You can continue reviewing or managing existing tasks
*   Task history and feedback are unaffected
