# Jules can surf the web

August 8, 2025

![Post Beta](/docs/_astro/websearch.DYAsPzEM_ZwyNyo.webp)

Jules can now proactively search the web for relevant content, documentation, or code snippets to help complete your tasks. This means Jules can get the information it needs, resulting in more accurate and successful task completion.

In Summary:

*   Jules can find the latest documentation for dependencies/libraries you’re using
*   Jules can proactively find examples or code snippets that can help inform its implementation

**Note**: web search works best when working on technical documentation. Queries like: “What is the latest news today?” are not supported.
