# Render images in the diff viewer

August 22, 2025

![Images in diff viewer](/docs/_astro/imagesdiffviewer.CfwMUfrJ_ZOic9c.webp)

Jules now intelligently renders images within the diff viewer, providing an immediate visual context for your modifications.

This means:

*   Instant Visual Feedback: When Jules generates images (like charts, diagrams, or web UI screenshots), you’ll see the actual image in the diff, not just its code representation.
*   Streamlined Workflow: No need to switch between tools or download files to see the results. Jules keeps everything in one place.

Try it out! Ask Jules to render an output, like a graph based on data, and commit it to your repository. You’ll be able to see the generated image seamlessly within your diff viewer.
