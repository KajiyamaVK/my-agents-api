Closing the loop from task to merge 🤝

Jules can now open a pull request directly from the UI. After a task completes, just use the new dropdown next to the ‘Publish Branch’ button to open a PR. Jules will request to merge the newly published branch into main, streamlining your entire workflow. Less context switching, faster merging.
