# Reviewing plans & giving feedback

Once you start a task in Jules, it generates a **plan** before writing any code. This lets you know the direction Jules will take while it works on the task. From here, you can also iterate with Jules on the plan before any code is written.

## Reviewing the plan

[Section titled “Reviewing the plan”](#reviewing-the-plan)

After setup (cloning your repo, initializing the VM, and installing dependencies), Jules will present its plan.

You’ll see:

*   A natural language description of what Jules intends to direction
*   Step-by-step breakdowns
*   Any assumptions or setup steps

1.  Open each step by expanding them to read through each one.
2.  Give feedback using the chat input if you need.
3.  Click **approve plan** when you’re ready for Jules to begin executing and writing code.

**Note:** If you navigate away, Jules will eventually auto-approve the plan, which is set on a timer. So there is no need to babysit.

## Giving feedback

[Section titled “Giving feedback”](#giving-feedback)

At any point, you can use the chat box to talk to Jules.

*   Ask it to revise a step
*   Point out something it missed
*   Clarify your original request
*   Answer its questions, or provide additional information Jules may need

Jules will respond and update its plan if needed.
