# Start from scratch—instantly

November 20, 2025

![Repoless](/docs/_astro/repoless.DOwVSlX1_DurJe.webp)

You can now start a Jules task immediately without selecting a repository. We’ve removed the speed bump between your idea and your code, allowing you to capture that spark of inspiration without the overhead.

To trigger this, simply click the “X” next to the selected repo to start a fresh, repoless session.

*   **Skip the Detour**: Previously, starting a fresh journey meant hopping over to GitHub to create an empty repo first. Now, you can bypass that context switch entirely and keep your momentum.
    
*   **Instant Ideation**: Whether you are prototyping a new feature or writing a quick script, you can dive straight into the logic. Just describe what you want, and Jules gets to work.
    

This update is available now for all users starting a new task.
