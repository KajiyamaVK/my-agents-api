# Repo view

The repo view gives you a focused workspace for interacting with a specific repository. From here, you can view task history, manage running tasks, and configure your environment.

## Accessing the repo view

[Section titled “Accessing the repo view”](#accessing-the-repo-view)

There are two ways to open a repo view:

1.  Click on any repository name from the sidebar task list
2.  Select a repo from the task picker, then click into it after starting a task

This opens a view scoped to that repository, including task history and available actions.

## Viewing tasks by repo

[Section titled “Viewing tasks by repo”](#viewing-tasks-by-repo)

Inside the repo view, you’ll see a list of all tasks associated with that repo:

*   **Running** tasks are listed at the top
*   **Completed** tasks include full logs and diffs
*   **Failed** or **waiting** tasks are clearly labeled

You can click on any task to reopen it, review the plan, or continue feedback.

## Starting a new task

[Section titled “Starting a new task”](#starting-a-new-task)

From the repo view, you can start a new task scoped to that repository:

*   Click **new tasks** in the top right corner
*   This will preselect the repo and branch
*   Enter your prompt and optimal setup script as usual
