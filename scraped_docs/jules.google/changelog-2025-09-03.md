We’ve shipped significant improvements to the Jules critic agent, making its feedback more insightful and reliable. To increase transparency and give you more insight into its evaluation process, you can now see the critic’s real-time analysis as it works.

Changes:

*   The critic’s thought process is now visible in the UI, showing its step-by-step evaluation of the code in real-time.
*   The critic’s now incorporates more contextual information when making decisions, leading to more accurate and relevant feedback on potential bugs and logic flaws.
