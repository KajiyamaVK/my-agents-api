**Jules Memory for Repositories:** We’re excited to introduce a new Memory feature! Jules now has the ability to learn from your interactions.

*   **How it works:** During a task, Jules will save your preferences, nudges, and corrections.
*   **The benefit:** The next time you run the same or a similar task in that specific repository, Jules will reference its memory to better anticipate your needs and follow your established patterns, leading to more accurate results with less guidance.
*   **Settings:** You can toggle memory on or off for the repo in the repo settings page under “Knowledge”
