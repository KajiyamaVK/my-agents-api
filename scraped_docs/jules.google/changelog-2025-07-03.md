# Improved task controls and other 💅 UI delight

July 3, 2025

![Task controls](/docs/_astro/polish-tasks-changelog.Bzf_pBWz_Z1mwEs.webp)

*   Pause, resume, and delete tasks—without losing your sense of place. Available from sidebar and repo view. You can even quickly copy task urls!
*   Non-urgent task icons are now more recessive
*   Certain hover states—which did not look good—have been toned back.
*   System messages have more consistent padding and borders
