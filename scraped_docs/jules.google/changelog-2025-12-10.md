# Enable suggested tasks to let Jules find issues proactively

December 10, 2025

![suggested](/docs/_astro/suggested.CKs87OFo_Z3hhig.webp)

Jules can now work proactively in the background to improve your code. With Suggested Tasks, Jules scans your repository for potential improvements and presents them on your repo page.

To get started, enable the proactive suggestions toggle on the repo page.

*   **Tackle the #TODOs**: In this initial release, Jules focuses on identifying `#TODO` comments in your code. It reads the context, formulates a plan, and presents it for your approval—turning idle comments into active solutions. More use cases coming soon.
    
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Once enabled, Jules continuously monitors your codebase. You don’t have to ask; just check your dashboard for new suggestions and approve the ones you want.
    

This experimental feature is available today for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers on up to five repositories.
