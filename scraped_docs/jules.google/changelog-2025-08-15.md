You’re now in full control of when your code gets to GitHub. No need to wait for a task to finish or ask Jules to do it for you. At any point during a task, just click the GitHub icon in the top right to publish the current work-in-progress as a new branch or open a pull request. This gives you more flexibility and control to review, test, or take over whenever you’re ready.
