# Critic Agent

August 8, 2025

Great developers don’t just write code, they question it. And now, so does Jules. We’ve built the Jules critic agent to ensure that every line of code isn’t just functional, but robust, secure, and efficient. It acts as an internal peer reviewer, challenging every proposed change to elevate the quality of the final output.

Some high level notes:

*   **Critic-augmented generation:** The Jules critic is integrated directly into the generation process. Every proposed change undergoes adversarial review before completion.
    
*   **Improved code quality:** The critic flags subtle bugs, missed edge cases, and inefficient code. Jules then uses this feedback to improve the patch in real-time.
    
*   **A new kind of review:** The critic is not just another linter or test. It understands the intent and context behind code, similar to a human peer reviewer.
    
*   **Built on research:** This feature draws on research into multi-step, tool interactive critiquing and actor-critic reinforcement learning, where an “actor” generates and a “critic” evaluates.
