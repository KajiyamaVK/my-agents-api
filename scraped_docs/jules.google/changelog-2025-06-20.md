# Jules Agent Update: Faster, Smarter, More Reliable

June 20, 2025

![Jules environment updates](/docs/_astro/agents-md-support.COimRein_13z6cT.webp)

We’ve shipped a big upgrade to the Jules agent under the hood.

What’s new:

*   **Smarter context.** Jules reads from AGENTS.md if it’s in your repo.
*   **Improved performance.** Tasks now complete faster—no numbers to share just yet, but you’ll feel it.
*   **Significantly reduced punting.** We tightened the loop to keep Jules moving forward.
*   **More reliable setup.** If you’ve added an environment setup script, Jules now runs it consistently.
*   **Better test habits.** Jules is more likely to write and run tests on its own.
