Today we are thrilled to announce that Jules is no longer in beta! Since launch just two months ago, Jules has passed over 140k public commits. Thank you to our amazing beta users for all your support and feedback.

In addition, we’re launching our pricing plans to unlock higher task limits, along with a bunch of quality improvements in the Jules app and agent. Here are the details:

*   Get higher task limits through the Google AI Pro and Ultra plans. More details at [Limits and Plans](./../usage-limits).
*   Jules now uses the power of Gemini 2.5 thinking when creating its plan, resulting in higher quality plans and more complete tasks
*   Numerous bug fixes so Jules gets stuck less, and is better at following your instructions in agents.md
