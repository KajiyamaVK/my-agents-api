September 23, 2025

Jules is now able to read and respond to your comments on pull requests!

When you start a review, Jules will add a 👀 emoji to each comment to let you know it’s been read. Based on your feedback, Jules will then push a commit with the requested changes.

For more control, you can switch to **Reactive Mode** in your [global Jules UI settings](https://jules.google.com/settings). In this mode, Jules will only act on comments where you specifically mention `@Jules`.
