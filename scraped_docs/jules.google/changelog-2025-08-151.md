# Increasing the VM Size to 20GB

August 15, 2025

We heard your feedback about running into disk space limits on larger projects. To address this, we’ve significantly increased the available disk space in the Jules VM to 20GB. This provides more room for large dependencies, build artifacts, and complex repositories, reducing disk-related failures so Jules can tackle bigger tasks. Happy Julesing!
