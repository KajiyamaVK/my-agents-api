# Automated fixes for Render deployments

December 10, 2025

![Render](/docs/_astro/changelog-render.D9zwsE_A_Z20xMym.webp)

We’ve integrated with Render to handle the last mile of shipping code. Jules can now detect failed builds, analyze the logs, and push fixes to its PRs before you even know your build failed.

To enable this, go to your Render Dashboard, open the Help menu (top-right), and click Coding Agents to provision your API Key. Paste this key into Settings > Integrations in Jules.

1.  **Instant Recovery:** No more context switching to dig through console logs. Jules detects the failure immediately and identifies the root cause.
2.  **Proactive Fixes:** Instead of just alerting you to an error, Jules writes the code to fix it. Review the solution as a standard commit on your PR, merge it, and get back to green.

This integration is available now. Check out the [docs](/integrations) for the full setup guide, including enabling PR previews.

**Note:** For now, Jules only fixes PRs it has created.
