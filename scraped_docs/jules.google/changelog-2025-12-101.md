You can now set recurring tasks for Jules. Whether it’s a weekly dependency check, a nightly lint fix, or a monthly cleanup, just define it once and Jules will handle the rest on your schedule.

To get started, navigate to the **Scheduled** tab on your repo page to configure your first task.

*   **Set it and forget it**: Define your maintenance chores once. Jules will wake up, perform the task, and open a PR without you needing to lift a finger.
    
*   **Never miss a beat**: No more manual prompts for the stuff that needs to happen every week. Ensure consistent code quality and dependency hygiene by automating your routine work.
    

This feature is available today for all Jules users.
