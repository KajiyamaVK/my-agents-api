Meet Interactive Plan. Instead of jumping straight to the solution, Jules will now read your codebase, ask clarifying questions, and work with you to refine the plan. This collaborative approach gives you more control and ensures you’re on the same page, leading to higher-quality code and a more reliable solution.

In summary:

*   Trigger the interactive plan from the dropdown when you start a task
*   Jules will start a brainstorm with you and ask clarifying questions
