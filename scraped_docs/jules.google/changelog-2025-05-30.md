# A faster, smoother and more reliable Jules

May 30, 2025

This week, our focus has been on improving reliability, fixing our GitHub integration, and scaling capacity.

**Here’s what’s we shipped:**

*   Updated our limits to 60 tasks per day, 5 concurrent.
*   We substantially improved the reliability of the GitHub sync. Export to GitHub should also be fixed on previously created tasks.
*   We’ve decreased the number of failure cases by 2/3
