# Quickstart

The Jules REST API lets you programmatically access Jules’s capabilities to automate and enhance your software development lifecycle. You can use the API to create custom workflows, automate tasks like bug fixing and code reviews, and embed Jules’s intelligence directly into the tools you use every day, such as Slack, Linear, and GitHub.

The Jules REST API is in an alpha release, which means it is experimental. Be aware that we may change specifications, API keys, and definitions as we work toward stabilization. In the future, we plan to maintain at least one stable and one experimental version.

## Authentication

[Section titled “Authentication”](#authentication)

To get started with the Jules REST API, you’ll need an API key.

### Generate Your API Key

[Section titled “Generate Your API Key”](#generate-your-api-key)

In the Jules web app, go to the **[Settings](https://jules.google.com/settings#api)** page to create a new API key. You can have at most 3 API keys at a time.

![Jules REST API Key creation interface](/docs/_astro/jules-api-key-settings.XPNzaqrV_Gzik3.webp)

### Use Your API Key

[Section titled “Use Your API Key”](#use-your-api-key)

To authenticate your requests, pass the API key in the `X-Goog-Api-Key` header of your API calls.

Keep your API keys secure. Don’t share them or embed them in public code. For your protection, any API keys found to be publicly exposed will be [automatically disabled](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/restricting-service-accounts#disable-exposed-keys) to prevent abuse.

## API concepts

[Section titled “API concepts”](#api-concepts)

The Jules REST API is built around a few core resources. Understanding these will help you use the API effectively.

*   **Source** — An input source for the agent (e.g., a GitHub repository). Before using a source using the API, you must first [install the Jules GitHub app](/docs/) through the Jules web app.
*   **Session** — A continuous unit of work within a specific context, similar to a chat session. A session is initiated with a prompt and a source.
*   **Activity** — A single unit of work within a Session. A Session contains multiple activities from both the user and the agent, such as generating a plan, sending a message, or updating progress.

## Your first API call

[Section titled “Your first API call”](#your-first-api-call)

We’ll walk through creating your first session with the Jules REST API using curl.

1.  ### List your available sources
    
    [Section titled “List your available sources”](#list-your-available-sources)
    
    First, you need to find the name of the source you want to work with (e.g., your GitHub repo). This command will return a list of all sources you have connected to Jules.
    
    ```
    curl -H "x-goog-api-key: $JULES_API_KEY" \
      https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sources
    ```
    
    The response will look something like this:
    
    ```
    {  "sources": [    {      "name": "sources/github/bobalover/boba",      "id": "github/bobalover/boba",      "githubRepo": {        "owner": "bobalover",        "repo": "boba"      }    }  ],  "nextPageToken": "github/bobalover/boba-web"}
    ```
    
2.  ### Create a new session
    
    [Section titled “Create a new session”](#create-a-new-session)
    
    Now, create a new session. You’ll need the source name from the previous step. This request tells Jules to create a boba app in the specified repository.
    
    ```
    curl 'https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions' \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $JULES_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "prompt": "Create a boba app!",
        "sourceContext": {
          "source": "sources/github/bobalover/boba",
          "githubRepoContext": {
            "startingBranch": "main"
          }
        },
        "automationMode": "AUTO_CREATE_PR",
        "title": "Boba App"
      }'
    ```
    
    The `automationMode` field is optional. By default, no PR will be automatically created.
    
    The immediate response will look something like this:
    
    ```
    {  "name": "sessions/31415926535897932384",  "id": "31415926535897932384",  "title": "Boba App",  "sourceContext": {    "source": "sources/github/bobalover/boba",    "githubRepoContext": {      "startingBranch": "main"    }  },  "prompt": "Create a boba app!"}
    ```
    
    You can poll the latest session information using `GetSession` or `ListSessions`. For example, if a PR was automatically created, you can see the PR in the session output:
    
    ```
    {  "name": "sessions/31415926535897932384",  "id": "31415926535897932384",  "title": "Boba App",  "sourceContext": {    "source": "sources/github/bobalover/boba",    "githubRepoContext": {      "startingBranch": "main"    }  },  "prompt": "Create a boba app!",  "outputs": [    {      "pullRequest": {        "url": "https://github.com/bobalover/boba/pull/35",        "title": "Create a boba app",        "description": "This change adds the initial implementation of a boba app."      }    }  ]}
    ```
    
    By default, sessions created through the API will have their plans automatically approved. If you want to create a session that requires explicit plan approval, set the `requirePlanApproval` field to `true`.
    
3.  ### List sessions
    
    [Section titled “List sessions”](#list-sessions)
    
    You can list your sessions as follows:
    
    ```
    curl 'https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions?pageSize=5' \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $JULES_API_KEY"
    ```
    
4.  ### Approve a plan
    
    [Section titled “Approve a plan”](#approve-a-plan)
    
    If your session requires explicit plan approval, you can approve the latest plan as follows:
    
    ```
    curl 'https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions/SESSION_ID:approvePlan' \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $JULES_API_KEY"
    ```
    
5.  ### Interact with the agent
    
    [Section titled “Interact with the agent”](#interact-with-the-agent)
    
    To list activities in a session:
    
    ```
    curl 'https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions/SESSION_ID/activities?pageSize=30' \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $JULES_API_KEY"
    ```
    
    To send a message to the agent:
    
    ```
    curl 'https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions/SESSION_ID:sendMessage' \
      -X POST \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -H "x-goog-api-key: $JULES_API_KEY" \
      -d '{
        "prompt": "Can you make the app corgi themed?"
      }'
    ```
    
    The response will be empty because the agent will send its response in the next activity. To see the agent’s response, list the activities again.

# Authentication

The Jules REST API uses API keys for authentication. You’ll need a valid API key to make API requests.

## Getting Your API Key

[Section titled “Getting Your API Key”](#getting-your-api-key)

1.  Go to [jules.google.com/settings](https://jules.google.com/settings)
2.  Find the **API Key** section
3.  Click **Generate API Key** (or copy your existing key)
4.  Store the key securely — it won’t be shown again

Keep your API key secret. Don’t commit it to version control or share it publicly.

## Using Your API Key

[Section titled “Using Your API Key”](#using-your-api-key)

Include the API key in the `x-goog-api-key` header with every request:

Terminal window

```
curl -H "x-goog-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \  https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions
```

### Environment Variable (Recommended)

[Section titled “Environment Variable (Recommended)”](#environment-variable-recommended)

Store your API key in an environment variable:

Terminal window

```
export JULES_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
```

Then use it in requests:

Terminal window

```
curl -H "x-goog-api-key: $JULES_API_KEY" \  https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions
```

## Example: Create a Session

[Section titled “Example: Create a Session”](#example-create-a-session)

Terminal window

```
curl -X POST \  -H "x-goog-api-key: $JULES_API_KEY" \  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \  -d '{    "prompt": "Add unit tests for the utils module",    "sourceContext": {      "source": "sources/github-owner-repo",      "githubRepoContext": {        "startingBranch": "main"      }    }  }' \  https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions
```

# Changelog

![suggested](/docs/_astro/suggested.CKs87OFo_Z3hhig.webp)

Jules can now work proactively in the background to improve your code. With Suggested Tasks, Jules scans your repository for potential improvements and presents them on your repo page.

To get started, enable the proactive suggestions toggle on the repo page.

*   **Tackle the #TODOs**: In this initial release, Jules focuses on identifying `#TODO` comments in your code. It reads the context, formulates a plan, and presents it for your approval—turning idle comments into active solutions. More use cases coming soon.
    
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Once enabled, Jules continuously monitors your codebase. You don’t have to ask; just check your dashboard for new suggestions and approve the ones you want.
    

This experimental feature is available today for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers on up to five repositories.

Read more at: [Suggested Tasks](https://jules.google/docs/suggested-tasks/).

![scheduled](/docs/_astro/scheduled.AQyQ1slh_1DtfJI.webp)

You can now set recurring tasks for Jules. Whether it’s a weekly dependency check, a nightly lint fix, or a monthly cleanup, just define it once and Jules will handle the rest on your schedule.

To get started, navigate to the **Scheduled** tab on your repo page to configure your first task.

*   **Set it and forget it**: Define your maintenance chores once. Jules will wake up, perform the task, and open a PR without you needing to lift a finger.
    
*   **Never miss a beat**: No more manual prompts for the stuff that needs to happen every week. Ensure consistent code quality and dependency hygiene by automating your routine work.
    

This feature is available today for all Jules users.

Read more at: [Scheduled Tasks](https://jules.google/docs/scheduled-tasks/).

![Render](/docs/_astro/changelog-render.D9zwsE_A_Z20xMym.webp)

We’ve integrated with Render to handle the last mile of shipping code. Jules can now detect failed builds, analyze the logs, and push fixes to its PRs before you even know your build failed.

To enable this, go to your Render Dashboard, open the Help menu (top-right), and click Coding Agents to provision your API Key. Paste this key into Settings > Integrations in Jules.

1.  **Instant Recovery:** No more context switching to dig through console logs. Jules detects the failure immediately and identifies the root cause.
2.  **Proactive Fixes:** Instead of just alerting you to an error, Jules writes the code to fix it. Review the solution as a standard commit on your PR, merge it, and get back to green.

This integration is available now. Check out the [docs](/integrations) for the full setup guide, including enabling PR previews.

**Note:** For now, Jules only fixes PRs it has created.

![Repoless](/docs/_astro/repoless.DOwVSlX1_DurJe.webp)

You can now start a Jules task immediately without selecting a repository. We’ve removed the speed bump between your idea and your code, allowing you to capture that spark of inspiration without the overhead.

To trigger this, simply click the “X” next to the selected repo to start a fresh, repoless session.

*   **Skip the Detour**: Previously, starting a fresh journey meant hopping over to GitHub to create an empty repo first. Now, you can bypass that context switch entirely and keep your momentum.
    
*   **Instant Ideation**: Whether you are prototyping a new feature or writing a quick script, you can dive straight into the logic. Just describe what you want, and Jules gets to work.
    

This update is available now for all users starting a new task.

![Gemini 3](/docs/_astro/gemini3.D-MJdx3W_ZmxvfP.webp)

Gemini 3 Pro is now available in Jules. This is the newest generation of the Gemini family, bringing clearer reasoning, stronger instruction following, and a meaningful lift in day-to-day reliability.

*   **Coherent Planning**: Multi-step tasks hold together more naturally. The agent requires less management during transitions, meaning your work moves forward with fewer detours.
    
*   **Visual Verification**: Leveraging the improved multimodal capabilities of Gemini 3 Pro, Jules renders and verifies web app outcomes with significantly higher precision.
    
*   **Agentic Memories**: The new model utilizes context more effectively, helping Jules adapt to your coding preferences and project nuances more reliably over time.
    

Gemini 3 Pro is rolling out now to Google AI Ultra users and will be available to Pro users in the coming days.

![Jules Tools](/docs/_astro/julestools2.DXhpIjxz_Z29bzv9.webp)

We’ve been busy shipping a bunch of new updates to the Jules Tools CLI to make your experience smoother and more powerful. Here’s a rundown of what’s new:

#### Parallel Task Execution

[Section titled “Parallel Task Execution”](#parallel-task-execution)

You can now start multiple parallel tasks for the same prompt using the `--parallel` flag with `jules remote new`. This is useful for getting multiple suggestions from Jules at once (max of 5).

*   **Added**: `--parallel` flag to `remote new` command.

#### v0.1.40 - WSL/Arch Linux Credential Fixes

[Section titled “v0.1.40 - WSL/Arch Linux Credential Fixes”](#v0140---wslarch-linux-credential-fixes)

We’ve refactored how we handle authentication to resolve credential issues for users on WSL and Arch Linux. This means broader platform support and no more login issues.

#### v0.1.39 - OAuth2 Error Handling Improvements

[Section titled “v0.1.39 - OAuth2 Error Handling Improvements”](#v0139---oauth2-error-handling-improvements)

We’ve enhanced our OAuth2 flow to be more resilient with better error recovery, making the authentication process more reliable.

#### v0.1.38 - Repository Inference Feature

[Section titled “v0.1.38 - Repository Inference Feature”](#v0138---repository-inference-feature)

To shorten CLI commands and reduce configuration, we’ve added repository inference. Now, Jules can automatically detect the repository from your current directory, so you don’t have to specify it manually.

#### v0.1.37 - PNPM Installation Fixes

[Section titled “v0.1.37 - PNPM Installation Fixes”](#v0137---pnpm-installation-fixes)

We’ve added better support for the PNPM package manager, ensuring full compatibility for a wider range of JavaScript projects.

#### v0.1.36 - Side-by-Side Diff Viewer + Bug Fixes

[Section titled “v0.1.36 - Side-by-Side Diff Viewer + Bug Fixes”](#v0136---side-by-side-diff-viewer--bug-fixes)

Reviewing code is now faster and more readable with the new side-by-side diff viewer in the TUI. We’ve also added comprehensive test coverage and fixed bugs related to auto-approval and timeout validation.

![API](/docs/_astro/api.BIk2dddI_4ERpt.webp)

You can now programmatically access Jules’s capabilities to automate your work and build powerful integrations. The Jules API is designed to help you seamlessly integrate Jules into your existing development workflows, unlocking new ways to automate and enhance the entire software development lifecycle.

**With the API, you can:**

*   Create custom integrations with tools like Slack for “ChatOps” workflows, allowing you to assign tasks directly from your chat client.
*   Automate bug fixing and feature implementation by connecting Jules to your project management tools like Linear or Jira.
*   Integrate Jules directly into your CI/CD pipelines in services like GitHub Actions.

Here’s a quick example of how to create a new task (a “Session”) using a cURL command:

```
curl 'https://jules.googleapis.com/v1alpha/sessions' \    -X POST \    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \    -H 'X-Goog-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY' \    -d '{      "prompt": "Create a boba app!",      "sourceContext": {        "source": "sources/github/bobalover/boba",        "githubRepoContext": {          "startingBranch": "main"        }      },      "title": "Boba App"    }'
```

For more examples see the [API documentation](https://developers.google.com/jules/api).

![Jules Tools](/docs/_astro/julestools.5p-1nZtH_Z2224ry.webp)

We’re launching Jules Tools, a new command-line interface designed to give you direct control over your AI coding agent, making it scriptable, customizable, and easy to integrate into your existing workflows.

**Key Features:**

*   **Direct Control:** Create tasks (jules remote new), list active sessions (jules remote list), and monitor Jules without leaving your command line.
*   **Apply Patches Locally:** Instantly pull work-in-progress code from an active Jules session and apply it to your local machine. This lets you test changes immediately, without waiting for a commit to GitHub.
*   **Scriptable & Composable:** Integrate Jules into your automations by piping in output from other tools like gh, jq, or cat.
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** For a more guided experience, launch the built-in terminal user interface (TUI) to create and manage tasks step-by-step.

**How to Install:**

![Environment Variables](/docs/_astro/envar.Dhbt8Wwu_eCuVm.webp)

You can now provide Jules with environment variables at the repository level. This enables Jules to access the project-specific configurations it needs to complete tasks, like running builds, executing tests, or interacting with different services.

**How It Works**:

*   **Add Variables in Repo Settings:** Navigate to your repository’s settings page to add your environment variables. They will be associated directly with your project.
*   **Enable for a Task:** When you start a new task with Jules, you’ll have the option to make these environment variables available to it.
*   **Task-Long Access:** Once enabled for a specific task, Jules will have access to the variables for the entire duration of that task. Please note that this setting cannot be changed after the task has begun.

We’re excited to see how this unlocks new and more complex workflows for you and your team! Let us know if you have any feedback.

![Memory](/docs/_astro/memory.C9CEa_2-_2m2Klf.webp)

**Jules Memory for Repositories:** We’re excited to introduce a new Memory feature! Jules now has the ability to learn from your interactions.

*   **How it works:** During a task, Jules will save your preferences, nudges, and corrections.
*   **The benefit:** The next time you run the same or a similar task in that specific repository, Jules will reference its memory to better anticipate your needs and follow your established patterns, leading to more accurate results with less guidance.
*   **Settings:** You can toggle memory on or off for the repo in the repo settings page under “Knowledge”

![File Selector](/docs/_astro/fileselector.7WfNoQbn_2m4uUx.webp)

You can now tell Jules exactly which files to work with for any given task. Use the new file selector to easily and precisely reference specific files.

This removes ambiguity and gives you more granular control over Jules’s actions, helping to tighten the context for your task.

![Jules responding to a PR comment](/docs/_astro/changelog-pr-comments.Cfoy5hKj_Z1h2RAm.webp)

Jules is now able to read and respond to your comments on pull requests!

When you start a review, Jules will add a 👀 emoji to each comment to let you know it’s been read. Based on your feedback, Jules will then push a commit with the requested changes.

For more control, you can switch to **Reactive Mode** in your [global Jules UI settings](https://jules.google.com/settings). In this mode, Jules will only act on comments where you specifically mention `@Jules`.

![image upload](/docs/_astro/changelog-019.C2qW8uJn_Z3euJL.webp)

Ahoy, mateys! To celebrate International Talk Like a Pirate Day, we’ve given Jules a temporary map to the treasure.

*   Jules Speaks Pirate: You’ll find your AI agent’s responses are a bit more… swashbuckling… for today only.
    
*   Same Great Logic: Fear not! Beneath the eyepatch and Jolly Roger, it’s the same powerful coding engine ready to help you plunder that backlog and send bugs to Davy Jones’ locker.
    

![image upload](/docs/_astro/image-upload.CXDvQ88D_Z1J34qe.webp)

You can now upload images when creating a task in Jules. Use this to show frontend bugs, design inspiration, UI mocks, or any visual context you want Jules to consider while generating code.

For now:

*   Only JPEG and PNG formats are supported.
*   You can uplaod as many images as you want, as long as the total size is under 5MB.
*   Image upload is only supported at task creation (we’re working on enabling it for follow-up prompts soon).

Note: If your task involves using assets (e.g. logos) directly in code, those must still be committed to your GitHub repo.

[Read more](https://jules.google/docs/running-tasks/) about Jules image support.

![Stacked Diff](/docs/_astro/changelog-017-fade.BsxUDclU_Z1eGKg5.webp)

To improve the code review experience, we’ve introduced a new stacked layout for the diff viewer. This change displays diffs for multiple files vertically on a single screen. The stacked view makes it easier to see related changes across your codebase at a glance, providing better context and speeding up your review process.

Changes:

*   The diff viewer now stacks file changes vertically by default
*   You can also toggle back to the previous tabbed diff viewer

![Improved Critic](/docs/_astro/changelog-016.DcExNlSl_ZDHzjl.webp)

We’ve shipped significant improvements to the Jules critic agent, making its feedback more insightful and reliable. To increase transparency and give you more insight into its evaluation process, you can now see the critic’s real-time analysis as it works.

Changes:

*   The critic’s thought process is now visible in the UI, showing its step-by-step evaluation of the code in real-time.
*   The critic’s now incorporates more contextual information when making decisions, leading to more accurate and relevant feedback on potential bugs and logic flaws.

![Sample Prompts](/docs/_astro/changelog-015.CXL47v6I_ZPLQu4.webp)

To help new users get started with Jules, we’ve added sample prompts to the home page. These static prompts provide examples of how to use Jules and can be added to the text box with a single click.

Changes:

*   Sample prompts are now displayed on the home page for all users.
*   Clicking on a sample prompt will add the text of the prompt to the input box.

![Images in diff viewer](/docs/_astro/imagesdiffviewer.CfwMUfrJ_ZOic9c.webp)

Jules now intelligently renders images within the diff viewer, providing an immediate visual context for your modifications.

This means:

*   Instant Visual Feedback: When Jules generates images (like charts, diagrams, or web UI screenshots), you’ll see the actual image in the diff, not just its code representation.
*   Streamlined Workflow: No need to switch between tools or download files to see the results. Jules keeps everything in one place.

Try it out! Ask Jules to render an output, like a graph based on data, and commit it to your repository. You’ll be able to see the generated image seamlessly within your diff viewer.

![Export](/docs/_astro/exportatanytime.CJ8dxdjQ_ZPOQjW.webp)

You’re now in full control of when your code gets to GitHub. No need to wait for a task to finish or ask Jules to do it for you. At any point during a task, just click the GitHub icon in the top right to publish the current work-in-progress as a new branch or open a pull request. This gives you more flexibility and control to review, test, or take over whenever you’re ready.

We heard your feedback about running into disk space limits on larger projects. To address this, we’ve significantly increased the available disk space in the Jules VM to 20GB. This provides more room for large dependencies, build artifacts, and complex repositories, reducing disk-related failures so Jules can tackle bigger tasks. Happy Julesing!

![Post Beta](/docs/_astro/websearch.DYAsPzEM_ZwyNyo.webp)

Jules can now proactively search the web for relevant content, documentation, or code snippets to help complete your tasks. This means Jules can get the information it needs, resulting in more accurate and successful task completion.

In Summary:

*   Jules can find the latest documentation for dependencies/libraries you’re using
*   Jules can proactively find examples or code snippets that can help inform its implementation

**Note**: web search works best when working on technical documentation. Queries like: “What is the latest news today?” are not supported.

![Post Beta](/docs/_astro/interactiveplan.BQJ_-8Fr_2dCy3W.webp)

Meet Interactive Plan. Instead of jumping straight to the solution, Jules will now read your codebase, ask clarifying questions, and work with you to refine the plan. This collaborative approach gives you more control and ensures you’re on the same page, leading to higher-quality code and a more reliable solution.

In summary:

*   Trigger the interactive plan from the dropdown when you start a task
*   Jules will start a brainstorm with you and ask clarifying questions

![Critic Agent](/docs/_astro/critic.M-N27lZA_ZXQtTP.webp)

Great developers don’t just write code, they question it. And now, so does Jules. We’ve built the Jules critic agent to ensure that every line of code isn’t just functional, but robust, secure, and efficient. It acts as an internal peer reviewer, challenging every proposed change to elevate the quality of the final output.

Some high level notes:

*   **Critic-augmented generation:** The Jules critic is integrated directly into the generation process. Every proposed change undergoes adversarial review before completion.
    
*   **Improved code quality:** The critic flags subtle bugs, missed edge cases, and inefficient code. Jules then uses this feedback to improve the patch in real-time.
    
*   **A new kind of review:** The critic is not just another linter or test. It understands the intent and context behind code, similar to a human peer reviewer.
    
*   **Built on research:** This feature draws on research into multi-step, tool interactive critiquing and actor-critic reinforcement learning, where an “actor” generates and a “critic” evaluates.
    

![Post Beta](/docs/_astro/computeruse.DsMoFBka_Z1cKxdK.webp)

Next time you are working on a front end project with Jules, ask it to verify its work and it’ll render the website and send you back a screenshot!

*   Ask Jules to complete a web development task and to verify the front end
*   Jules will send you a screenshot of the front end along with any code changes
*   The default Jules base image now includes Playwright for front end testing
*   Users can also add images in the form of public URLs for Jules to use as input

![Post Beta](/docs/_astro/post-beta.CHZ_x9Mj_Wiixs.webp)

Today we are thrilled to announce that Jules is no longer in beta! Since launch just two months ago, Jules has passed over 140k public commits. Thank you to our amazing beta users for all your support and feedback.

In addition, we’re launching our pricing plans to unlock higher task limits, along with a bunch of quality improvements in the Jules app and agent. Here are the details:

*   Jules now uses the power of Gemini 2.5 thinking when creating its plan, resulting in higher quality plans and more complete tasks
*   Numerous bug fixes so Jules gets stuck less, and is better at following your instructions in agents.md

![Env Snapshot](/docs/_astro/envsnapshot.Da7EUEdt_e5gX8.webp)

Jules now creates a snapshot of your environment when you add environment setup scripts. For complicated environment, users should see faster and more consistent task execution.

In summary:

*   Jules will now snapshot your environment when you provide an environment setup script
*   Snapshots are loaded automatically next time you run a task
*   This provides for faster task startups, especially for complex environments
*   You can find environment configuration by clicking the “codebase” in the left hand panel, or by clicking the “configure environment” button in the task pane.

![Open a PR](/docs/_astro/openapr.B4vE52yX_1KUfVl.webp)

Closing the loop from task to merge 🤝

Jules can now open a pull request directly from the UI. After a task completes, just use the new dropdown next to the ‘Publish Branch’ button to open a PR. Jules will request to merge the newly published branch into main, streamlining your entire workflow. Less context switching, faster merging.

![Bun](/docs/_astro/jules_3bun.CJ2DViw__ZNLTEL.webp)

Jules now supports [Bun](https://bun.sh/). You can run tasks using Bun out of the box, no extra setup required. This expands compatibility for projects that use Bun instead of Node.

[Read more](https://jules.google.com/docs/environment/) about the jules base image and what tooling works with Jules.

![Task controls](/docs/_astro/polish-tasks-changelog.Bzf_pBWz_Z1mwEs.webp)

*   Pause, resume, and delete tasks—without losing your sense of place. Available from sidebar and repo view. You can even quickly copy task urls!
*   Non-urgent task icons are now more recessive
*   Certain hover states—which did not look good—have been toned back.

August 8, 2025

![Post Beta](/docs/_astro/interactiveplan.BQJ_-8Fr_2dCy3W.webp)

Meet Interactive Plan. Instead of jumping straight to the solution, Jules will now read your codebase, ask clarifying questions, and work with you to refine the plan. This collaborative approach gives you more control and ensures you’re on the same page, leading to higher-quality code and a more reliable solution.

In summary:

*   Trigger the interactive plan from the dropdown when you start a task
*   Jules will start a brainstorm with you and ask clarifying questions

# Critic Agent

August 8, 2025

![Critic Agent](/docs/_astro/critic.M-N27lZA_ZXQtTP.webp)

Great developers don’t just write code, they question it. And now, so does Jules. We’ve built the Jules critic agent to ensure that every line of code isn’t just functional, but robust, secure, and efficient. It acts as an internal peer reviewer, challenging every proposed change to elevate the quality of the final output.

Some high level notes:

*   **Critic-augmented generation:** The Jules critic is integrated directly into the generation process. Every proposed change undergoes adversarial review before completion.
    
*   **Improved code quality:** The critic flags subtle bugs, missed edge cases, and inefficient code. Jules then uses this feedback to improve the patch in real-time.
    
*   **A new kind of review:** The critic is not just another linter or test. It understands the intent and context behind code, similar to a human peer reviewer.
    
*   **Built on research:** This feature draws on research into multi-step, tool interactive critiquing and actor-critic reinforcement learning, where an “actor” generates and a “critic” evaluates.

# Export at any time

August 15, 2025

![Export](/docs/_astro/exportatanytime.CJ8dxdjQ_ZPOQjW.webp)

You’re now in full control of when your code gets to GitHub. No need to wait for a task to finish or ask Jules to do it for you. At any point during a task, just click the GitHub icon in the top right to publish the current work-in-progress as a new branch or open a pull request. This gives you more flexibility and control to review, test, or take over whenever you’re ready.

# Render images in the diff viewer

August 22, 2025

![Images in diff viewer](/docs/_astro/imagesdiffviewer.CfwMUfrJ_ZOic9c.webp)

Jules now intelligently renders images within the diff viewer, providing an immediate visual context for your modifications.

This means:

*   Instant Visual Feedback: When Jules generates images (like charts, diagrams, or web UI screenshots), you’ll see the actual image in the diff, not just its code representation.
*   Streamlined Workflow: No need to switch between tools or download files to see the results. Jules keeps everything in one place.

Try it out! Ask Jules to render an output, like a graph based on data, and commit it to your repository. You’ll be able to see the generated image seamlessly within your diff viewer.

# Image upload

September 9, 2025

![image upload](/docs/_astro/image-upload.CXDvQ88D_Z1J34qe.webp)

You can now upload images when creating a task in Jules. Use this to show frontend bugs, design inspiration, UI mocks, or any visual context you want Jules to consider while generating code.

For now:

*   Only JPEG and PNG formats are supported.
*   You can uplaod as many images as you want, as long as the total size is under 5MB.
*   Image upload is only supported at task creation (we’re working on enabling it for follow-up prompts soon).

Note: If your task involves using assets (e.g. logos) directly in code, those must still be committed to your GitHub repo.

# Use Environment Variables In Jules

October 1, 2025

![Environment Variables](/docs/_astro/envar.Dhbt8Wwu_eCuVm.webp)

You can now provide Jules with environment variables at the repository level. This enables Jules to access the project-specific configurations it needs to complete tasks, like running builds, executing tests, or interacting with different services.

**How It Works**:

*   **Add Variables in Repo Settings:** Navigate to your repository’s settings page to add your environment variables. They will be associated directly with your project.
*   **Enable for a Task:** When you start a new task with Jules, you’ll have the option to make these environment variables available to it.
*   **Task-Long Access:** Once enabled for a specific task, Jules will have access to the variables for the entire duration of that task. Please note that this setting cannot be changed after the task has begun.

We’re excited to see how this unlocks new and more complex workflows for you and your team! Let us know if you have any feedback.

# New Jules Tools CLI Updates: Side-by-Side Diffs, Repo Inference, and More

November 10, 2025

![Jules Tools](/docs/_astro/julestools2.DXhpIjxz_Z29bzv9.webp)

We’ve been busy shipping a bunch of new updates to the Jules Tools CLI to make your experience smoother and more powerful. Here’s a rundown of what’s new:

#### Parallel Task Execution

[Section titled “Parallel Task Execution”](#parallel-task-execution)

You can now start multiple parallel tasks for the same prompt using the `--parallel` flag with `jules remote new`. This is useful for getting multiple suggestions from Jules at once (max of 5).

*   **Added**: `--parallel` flag to `remote new` command.

#### v0.1.40 - WSL/Arch Linux Credential Fixes

[Section titled “v0.1.40 - WSL/Arch Linux Credential Fixes”](#v0140---wslarch-linux-credential-fixes)

We’ve refactored how we handle authentication to resolve credential issues for users on WSL and Arch Linux. This means broader platform support and no more login issues.

#### v0.1.39 - OAuth2 Error Handling Improvements

[Section titled “v0.1.39 - OAuth2 Error Handling Improvements”](#v0139---oauth2-error-handling-improvements)

We’ve enhanced our OAuth2 flow to be more resilient with better error recovery, making the authentication process more reliable.

#### v0.1.38 - Repository Inference Feature

[Section titled “v0.1.38 - Repository Inference Feature”](#v0138---repository-inference-feature)

To shorten CLI commands and reduce configuration, we’ve added repository inference. Now, Jules can automatically detect the repository from your current directory, so you don’t have to specify it manually.

#### v0.1.37 - PNPM Installation Fixes

[Section titled “v0.1.37 - PNPM Installation Fixes”](#v0137---pnpm-installation-fixes)

We’ve added better support for the PNPM package manager, ensuring full compatibility for a wider range of JavaScript projects.

#### v0.1.36 - Side-by-Side Diff Viewer + Bug Fixes

[Section titled “v0.1.36 - Side-by-Side Diff Viewer + Bug Fixes”](#v0136---side-by-side-diff-viewer--bug-fixes)

# Start from scratch—instantly

November 20, 2025

![Repoless](/docs/_astro/repoless.DOwVSlX1_DurJe.webp)

You can now start a Jules task immediately without selecting a repository. We’ve removed the speed bump between your idea and your code, allowing you to capture that spark of inspiration without the overhead.

To trigger this, simply click the “X” next to the selected repo to start a fresh, repoless session.

*   **Skip the Detour**: Previously, starting a fresh journey meant hopping over to GitHub to create an empty repo first. Now, you can bypass that context switch entirely and keep your momentum.
    
*   **Instant Ideation**: Whether you are prototyping a new feature or writing a quick script, you can dive straight into the logic. Just describe what you want, and Jules gets to work.
    

This update is available now for all users starting a new task.

# Enable suggested tasks to let Jules find issues proactively

December 10, 2025

![suggested](/docs/_astro/suggested.CKs87OFo_Z3hhig.webp)

Jules can now work proactively in the background to improve your code. With Suggested Tasks, Jules scans your repository for potential improvements and presents them on your repo page.

To get started, enable the proactive suggestions toggle on the repo page.

*   **Tackle the #TODOs**: In this initial release, Jules focuses on identifying `#TODO` comments in your code. It reads the context, formulates a plan, and presents it for your approval—turning idle comments into active solutions. More use cases coming soon.
    
*   **Continuous Improvement**: Once enabled, Jules continuously monitors your codebase. You don’t have to ask; just check your dashboard for new suggestions and approve the ones you want.
    

This experimental feature is available today for Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers on up to five repositories.

# Automated fixes for Render deployments

December 10, 2025

![Render](/docs/_astro/changelog-render.D9zwsE_A_Z20xMym.webp)

We’ve integrated with Render to handle the last mile of shipping code. Jules can now detect failed builds, analyze the logs, and push fixes to its PRs before you even know your build failed.

To enable this, go to your Render Dashboard, open the Help menu (top-right), and click Coding Agents to provision your API Key. Paste this key into Settings > Integrations in Jules.

1.  **Instant Recovery:** No more context switching to dig through console logs. Jules detects the failure immediately and identifies the root cause.
2.  **Proactive Fixes:** Instead of just alerting you to an error, Jules writes the code to fix it. Review the solution as a standard commit on your PR, merge it, and get back to green.

This integration is available now. Check out the [docs](/integrations) for the full setup guide, including enabling PR previews.

**Note:** For now, Jules only fixes PRs it has created.

# Practical Examples & Scripting

Jules Tools is designed to be scriptable and can be composed with other command-line tools.

Below are some examples of Jules Tools in action:

**1\. Create sessions from a TODO.md file:**

Assign each line item from a local TODO.md file as a new session in the current repository.

```
cat TODO.md | while IFS= read -r line; do  jules remote new --repo . --session "$line"done
```

**2\. Create a session from a GitHub Issue:**

Pipe the title of the first GitHub issue assigned to you directly into a new Jules session. (Requires the gh and jq CLIs).

```
gh issue list --assignee @me --limit 1 --json title \  | jq -r '.[0].title' \  | jules remote new --repo .
```

**3\. Use Gemini to analyze and assign the hardest issue to Jules:** Use the Gemini CLI to analyze your assigned GitHub issues, identify the most tedious one, and pipe its title to Jules.

```
gemini -p "find the most tedious issue, print it verbatim\n$(gh issue list --assignee @me)" \  | jules remote new --repo .
```

# Jules Tools Reference

Jules Tools is a lightweight command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with Jules, Google’s autonomous AI coding agent. It allows you to manage coding sessions, inspect progress, and integrate Jules into your existing development workflows and scripts directly from your terminal.

Think of Jules Tools as both a command surface and a dashboard for your coding agent, designed to keep you in your flow without needing to switch to a web browser.

## Installation

[Section titled “Installation”](#installation)

To get started, install the tool globally using npm or pnpm.

```
npm install -g @google/jules
```

Once installed, the jules command will be available in your terminal.

### Authentication

[Section titled “Authentication”](#authentication)

Before you can use the tool, you must authenticate with your Google account.

### Login

[Section titled “Login”](#login)

```
jules login
```

This command will open a browser window to guide you through the Google authentication process.

### Logout

[Section titled “Logout”](#logout)

To log out from your account:

```
jules logout
```

## Usage

[Section titled “Usage”](#usage)

The CLI is built around commands and subcommands. You can get help for any command by using the -h or —help flag.

```
# Get general helpjules help
# Get help for a specific command (e.g., remote)jules remote --help
```

### Global Flags

[Section titled “Global Flags”](#global-flags)

*   `-h`, `--help`: Displays help information for jules or a specific command.
    
*   `--theme <string>`: Sets the theme for the terminal user interface (TUI). Options are `dark` (default) or `light`.
    

Example: `jules --theme light`

### Available Commands

[Section titled “Available Commands”](#available-commands)

`version`

Shows the currently installed version of the Jules Tools CLI.

```
jules version
```

`remote`

The `remote` command is the primary way to interact with Jules sessions running in the cloud. It has several subcommands.

`remote list` Lists your connected repositories or active sessions.

*   `--repo`: Flag to list all repositories connected to Jules.
    
*   `--session`: Flag to list all your remote sessions.
    

_Examples:_

```
# List all connected repositoriesjules remote list --repo
# List all active and past sessionsjules remote list --session
```

`remote new`

Creates a new remote session to delegate a task to Jules.

Jules can automatically infer the repository from your current working directory, so you can often omit the `--repo` flag.

*   `--repo <repo_name>`: Specifies the repository for the session (e.g., torvalds/linux or . for the current directory’s repo).
    
*   `--session "<prompt>"`: A string describing the task for Jules to perform.
    
*   `--parallel <number>`: Starts multiple parallel sessions to work on the same task.
    

_Example:_

```
# Start a new session to write unit tests in the 'torvalds/linux' repojules remote new --repo torvalds/linux --session "write unit tests"
```

`remote pull`

Pulls the results (e.g., code changes) from a completed session.

*   `--session <session_id>`: The ID of the session you want to pull.

_Example:_

```
# Pull the results for session ID 123456jules remote pull --session 123456
```

`completion`

Generates an autocompletion script for your shell (e.g., bash, zsh) to enable tab completion for jules commands.

```
# Generate completion script for bashjules completion bash
```

## Interactive Dashboard (TUI)

[Section titled “Interactive Dashboard (TUI)”](#interactive-dashboard-tui)

For a more interactive, visual experience, you can launch the Terminal User Interface (TUI) by running the jules command without any arguments.

```
jules
```

The TUI provides a dashboard view of your sessions, a side-by-side diff viewer for reviewing changes, and guided flows for creating new ones, similar to the web UI.

# Reviewing code changes

Once you approve a plan, Jules begins working inside a virtual machine. As it completes steps, you’ll see an activity log with Jules’ thoughts and code updates. This page walks you through what to look for and how to respond.

## Activity feed

[Section titled “Activity feed”](#activity-feed)

As Jules works, you’ll see a real-time **activity feed** that logs:

*   Each step it completes
*   Descriptions of what it did
*   Any outputs or errors encountered
*   Requests for additional information or feedback

This feed gives you insight into Jules’ decision-making and progress.

## Code diffs

[Section titled “Code diffs”](#code-diffs)

When Jules changes code, you’ll see a **mini diff** directly in the feed. For a more complete view:

*   On the right pane, you can view a full screen expanded **diff editor** to see all changes across files
*   The **diff editor** only shows files where it modified or added code.
*   Expand the diff editor to full screen, or drag the left sidebar of the diff editor to slide it to your preferred width

You can download and copy code that Jules has written from the download and copy icons located in the top right of the diff editor panel. When you copy code, only the updated code will save to your clip board (not the full diff).

This is your central hub for understanding the scope of the changes Jules made to your repo.

## Interactive feedback

[Section titled “Interactive feedback”](#interactive-feedback)

You can interact with Jules in real-time through the chat box:

*   Ask it to revise logic or naming
*   Request additional tests or cleanup
*   Give corrections like “return an empty string instead of None”

## Task summary

[Section titled “Task summary”](#task-summary)

When the task completes, Jules provides a final summary which includes:

*   ✅ **Files changed**
*   ⏱ **Total runtime**
*   ➕ **Lines of code added/changed**
*   🌿 **Branch name** and **commit message**

![Screenshot of summary](/docs/_astro/done.TcJfaelI_22FvfH.webp)

## Pushing to GitHub

[Section titled “Pushing to GitHub”](#pushing-to-github)

Click **Publish branch** or **Publish PR** to push Jules’ changes to GitHub:

*   Jules will appear as a commit author on the branch, if you manually create a PR from the branch, you will be the PR author
*   When publishing a PR, Jules will appear as the creator of the PR

Once a branch is published, you can continue editing the branch, review it as a GitHub PR, or delete it.

Once a PR is created, you can send it for review, or merge the PR into your codebase.

# Environment setup

Jules runs each task inside a secure, short-lived virtual machine (VM). This lets it clone your repository, install dependencies, and run tests.

For simple environments, Jules studies your repository to learn how to quickly setup your environment without a provided setup script. Jules will also refer to agents.md or your readme.md file for hints to setup an environment on the fly.

For compex environments, you can provide a **setup script** to be run explicitly that prepare the environment.

## What’s preinstalled?

[Section titled “What’s preinstalled?”](#whats-preinstalled)

Every Jules VM runs Ubuntu Linux and includes many popular developer tools out of the box:

*   Node.js
*   Bun
*   Python
*   Go
*   Java
*   Rust

The latest versions can be seen here:

# Errors and failures

Even though Jules automates many parts of the development process, things can go wrong such as environment misconfigurations to task failures. This page covers how Jules reports errors, what it does automatically, and how you can debug issues.

## How errors are reported

[Section titled “How errors are reported”](#how-errors-are-reported)

Jules surfaces errors in two key places:

*   The **activity feed**, where the step failed is logged
*   A **notification badge** (red dot) in the UI

These errors can show up whether the task has failed completely or simply requires your intervention.

## Automatic retry behavior

[Section titled “Automatic retry behavior”](#automatic-retry-behavior)

Jules will attempt to retry failed steps automatically when possible. For example:

*   Network hiccups
*   Transient install errors
*   Slow dependency resolutions

After multiple retries, if the problem persists, the task will be marked as **failed**.

## Common causes of failure

[Section titled “Common causes of failure”](#common-causes-of-failure)

The most frequent issues are:

*   Incomplete or missing **environment setup scripts**
*   Prompts that are too vague or overly broad
*   Repos with unusual or nonstandard build systems
*   Long-running processes (like `npm run dev`) included in setup

## Debugging environment setup

[Section titled “Debugging environment setup”](#debugging-environment-setup)

You can retry a task by:

*   Clicking **rerun** from the task summary view
*   Modifying your setup script or prompt before restarting the task

Make sure to address any specific feedback from the failure logs.

# FAQ

## What is Jules?

[Section titled “What is Jules?”](#what-is-jules)

Jules is a software coding agent that helps you fix bugs, add documentation, update your app, and implement new features. It integrates with GitHub and works autonomously — meaning you can submit a task, go do something else, and return when it’s done. Jules is currently in Public Beta.

## Is Jules available without cost?

[Section titled “Is Jules available without cost?”](#is-jules-available-without-cost)

Jules has multiple plans to fit your development needs, including a plan available to all users without cost. See the [Limits and Plans](./../usage-limits) section for more details.

## How does Jules work under the hood?

[Section titled “How does Jules work under the hood?”](#how-does-jules-work-under-the-hood)

Each task runs in a fresh virtual machine where Jules clones your repo, installs dependencies, and makes changes based on your prompt. You can provide setup scripts to ensure your project builds and tests correctly.

## How does Jules run code, and what should I know about security?

[Section titled “How does Jules run code, and what should I know about security?”](#how-does-jules-run-code-and-what-should-i-know-about-security)

When you run code in Jules, it’s executed in a secure, cloud-based virtual machine (VM) with internet access. While this gives you powerful tools to test, build, and debug in context, it’s important to treat the environment with the same security precautions you would for any public or shared compute surface. If you’re not sure whether something is safe to run, we recommend reviewing it carefully (including non-code components). Jules is a large language model based system which operates on both the code and non-code files in a repository.

**You are responsible for the code you run.** That means:

*   **Don’t commit secrets** (like API keys, tokens, or credentials) to your repo, especially if you’re pulling code into Jules from a Git provider.
*   **Avoid known security vulnerabilities** in your dependencies or scripts. Consider following [GitHub’s Quickstart](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/quickstart-for-securing-your-repository) for securing your repository if you’re using GitHub.
*   **Be cautious with third-party packages or shell commands** that could compromise your system, your data, or others.

## Can Jules run long-lived commands like `npm run dev`?

[Section titled “Can Jules run long-lived commands like npm run dev?”](#can-jules-run-long-lived-commands-like-npm-run-dev)

No. Long-running processes like dev servers or watch scripts aren’t currently supported in setup scripts. Use discrete install/test commands instead.

## What languages does Jules support?

[Section titled “What languages does Jules support?”](#what-languages-does-jules-support)

Jules is language agnostic but works best with projects that use:

*   JavaScript/TypeScript
*   Python
*   Go
*   Java
*   Rust

Support depends on what’s installed on the VM and the clarity of your environment setup script.

## Can I leave Jules while its working?

[Section titled “Can I leave Jules while its working?”](#can-i-leave-jules-while-its-working)

Yes! Jules is designed to be autonomous. You can leave the app after submitting a task. Make sure to [enable notifications](../#enabling-notifications) so you’ll be alerted when a plan is ready or a task completes.

## How do I provide feedback or report a bug?

[Section titled “How do I provide feedback or report a bug?”](#how-do-i-provide-feedback-or-report-a-bug)

Click the **[feedback](../feedback)** button in the bottom left of the Jules UI. No account or tracking system required — feedback goes straight to the team.

## What happens if a task fails?

[Section titled “What happens if a task fails?”](#what-happens-if-a-task-fails)

Jules will retry automatically. If it continues to fail, it will mark the task as failed and notify you. Common causes include broken setup scripts or vague prompts.

You can revise and rerun the task once you’ve addressed the issue.

## How many tasks can I run?

[Section titled “How many tasks can I run?”](#how-many-tasks-can-i-run)

Limits are listed [here](./../usage-limits).

## Can I change which repos Jules has access to?

[Section titled “Can I change which repos Jules has access to?”](#can-i-change-which-repos-jules-has-access-to)

Yes. Go to your GitHub settings:

1.  Click your profile —> **settings**
2.  Select **applications** in the sidebar
3.  Find **Google Labs Jules** and click **configure**
4.  Adjust repository access

Then refresh Jules and your new repos will appear. [Learn more about managing tasks and repositories](./../tasks-repos).

## Does Jules train on private repos?

[Section titled “Does Jules train on private repos?”](#does-jules-train-on-private-repos)

No. Jules does **not** train on private repository content. Privacy is a core principle for Jules, and we do not use your private repositories to train models. [Learn more](https://jules.google.com/legal) about how your data is used to improve Jules.

# Continuous AI Overview

![David East](/docs/_astro/davideast.B_hMd2Id.jpeg)

David EastDecember 18, 2025

Last week, we shipped **Continuous AI** at Jules. This is a massive shift in how you’re going to work with Jules moving forward.

We’ve added three key features that turn Jules from a tool you use into a system that works for you. Here’s the breakdown:

### Suggested Tasks

[Section titled “Suggested Tasks”](#suggested-tasks)

Stop hunting through your codebase for that one `// TODO` you forgot about.

![Suggested Tasks](/docs/_astro/suggested-tasks.1TOSQ67f_oiviu.webp)

When you toggle the **Suggested Task** switch, Jules analyzes your entire codebase to find those floating comments and surfaces them as actionable tasks right in your dashboard.

Jules finds these tasks and analyzes them in context, providing a rationale for the change, and even giving you a confidence score on making that change independently. You can kick off multiple tasks in parallel and watch your to-do list shrink in real-time.

**Pro-Tip:** If you enable this and don’t see any suggestions, it just means you’re too organized! To get things moving, write a prompt asking Jules to analyze and raise specific inline to-dos. Once that’s committed, Jules will surface those new tasks automatically.

### Scheduled Tasks

[Section titled “Scheduled Tasks”](#scheduled-tasks)

This might be my personal favorite. **Scheduled Tasks** allow you to write a prompt and set it to run on a daily, weekly, or monthly interval.

![Scheduled Tasks](/docs/_astro/scheduled-tasks.C8CPiSJL_Z1ErBKp.webp)

This unlocks some incredible use cases for CI/CD. We’ve all been there: a build breaks, and you have to drop everything to fix it. Now, you can run those builds on a schedule, and if something breaks, Jules can step in and fix it for you.

In the video you’ll see that I scheduled a task that creates a nightly release to NPM for a library. In the past, when it’s been broken, Jules caught it, figured out the fix, and published it under the nightly tag.

### Render Integration

[Section titled “Render Integration”](#render-integration)

To close the loop on Continuous AI, you need a tight feedback loop. That’s why we’ve integrated Jules with **Render**.

![Render](/docs/_astro/changelog-render.D9zwsE_A_Z20xMym.webp)

Render is a fantastic cloud platform for hosting web services, and it has a great integration with GitHub that creates preview deployments for PRs. But sometimes, those builds fail.

Now, when a build fails on Render, it automatically reports that failure back to Jules. Jules then analyzes the error, works on a fix, and sends a commit back to your PR—which triggers a fresh, successful redeploy. It’s an automated loop that keeps your deployment pipeline moving without manual intervention.

### The Big Picture

[Section titled “The Big Picture”](#the-big-picture)

When you combine **Suggested Tasks**, **Scheduled Tasks**, and the **Render Integration**, you aren’t just using an AI assistant anymore. You’re building a continuous system for your apps, websites, and libraries.

We are incredibly excited to see how you use these new features to keep your code moving.

# Getting started

Jules is an experimental coding agent that helps you fix bugs, add documentation, and build new features. It integrates with GitHub, understands your codebase, and works **autonomously** — so you can move on while it handles the task.

This guide will walk you through setting up Jules and running your first task.

## Login

[Section titled “Login”](#login)

1.  Visit [jules.google.com](https://jules.google.com)
2.  Sign in with your Google account.
3.  Accept the privacy notice (one‑time).

## Connect GitHub

[Section titled “Connect GitHub”](#connect-github)

Jules needs access to your repositories in order to work.

1.  Click **Connect to GitHub account.**
2.  Complete the login flow.
3.  Choose _all_ or specific repos that you want to connect to Jules.
4.  You will be redirected back to Jules. If not, try refreshing the page.

Once connected, you’ll see a **repo selector** where you can select the repo you want Jules to work with, and a prompt input box.

## Starting your first task

[Section titled “Starting your first task”](#starting-your-first-task)

Jules runs in a virtual machine where it clones your code, installs dependencies, and modifies files.

1.  Pick a repository from the repo selector.
2.  Choose the branch you want Jules to work on. The default branch will be selected already. You do not have to modify this unless you want Jules to work on a specific branch.
3.  Write a clear, specific prompt. For example, `Add a test for "parseQueryString` function in utils.js
4.  (Optional) Add environment setup scripts.
5.  Click **Give me a plan**

Once you submit a task, Jules will generate a plan. You can review and approve it before any code changes are made.

![Screenshot of prompt](/docs/_astro/starting_a_task1.B_FC3NW0_Nxkrg.webp)

## Include AGENTS.md file

[Section titled “Include AGENTS.md file”](#include-agentsmd-file)

Jules now automatically looks for a file named AGENTS.md in the root of your repository. This file can describe the agents or tools in your codebase, such as what they do, how to interact with them, or any input and output conventions. Jules uses this file to better understand your code and generate more relevant plans and completions.

**Tip:** Keep AGENTS.md up to date. It helps Jules and your teammates work with your repo more effectively.

## Enabling notifications

[Section titled “Enabling notifications”](#enabling-notifications)

You are free to leave Jules while it is running. To stay informed:

1.  When prompted, enable browser notifications.
2.  Go to **Settings —> notifications** at any time to enable or disable notifications.

You’ll be notified when the task completes or needs your input.

![Notifications](/docs/_astro/notifications.C0W_9Pe7_dT6e0.webp)

# Integrations

Jules works best when it has the same context you do. By connecting your external tools, you enable Jules to autonomously detect bugs, read build logs, and understand project requirements without manual input.

## Deployment & CI/CD

[Section titled “Deployment & CI/CD”](#deployment--cicd)

Connect your deployment pipelines to let Jules automatically detect build failures and propose fixes.

[Render](/docs/integrations/render) Automatically retrieve build logs and fix deployment failures. Jules watches for failed builds, analyzes the logs, and pushes fixes directly to Jules' PRs.

## How Integrations Work

[Section titled “How Integrations Work”](#how-integrations-work)

Jules uses **scoped access** to interact with your tools. When you connect an integration:

1.  **Read-Only by default:** Unless otherwise specified, Jules requests the minimum permissions needed to read logs or status updates.
2.  **Autonomous triggers:** Integrations allow Jules to wake up based on external events (like a failed web hook) rather than waiting for you to type a prompt.
3.  **Secure storage:** API keys are encrypted and stored securely. They are never exposed in the chat interface or shared between sessions.

--- END OF FILE: integrations-render.md ---
--- START OF FILE: integrations-render.md ---

Source: https://jules.google/docs/integrations/render

# Render Integration

Turn deployment failures into instant fixes. By connecting Jules to Render, you empower it to watch your builds, analyze errors, and push fixes before you even switch context.

## Prerequisites

[Section titled “Prerequisites”](#prerequisites)

Before generating your API key, ensure your Render and GitHub environments are ready:

1.  **Enable Pull Request Previews:** Go to your Render dashboard and [enable Pull Request Previews](https://render.com/docs/service-previews?utm_source=jules#pull-request-previews-git-backed).
2.  **Verify GitHub Permissions:** Check your [GitHub Installations](https://github.com/settings/installations).
    *   Locate **Google Labs Jules**.
    *   If you see a **Review Request** link next to it, click it to accept the updated permissions.
    *   If there is no link, your permissions are already up to date.

## Setup

[Section titled “Setup”](#setup)

1.  **Provision a Key** Navigate to the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com?utm_source=jules). Click the **Help menu** (top-right) and select **Coding Agents** to open the provisioning screen.
    
    _Alternatively, visit [dashboard.render.com/jules](https://dashboard.render.com/jules?utm_source=jules) directly._
    
2.  **Create the Key** Click **Create API key**. Copy the key displayed.
    
    This key is shown only once. If you lose it, you will need to provision a new one.
    
3.  **Connect to Jules** In Jules, go to [Settings > Integrations](https://jules.google.com/settings/integrations). Paste the key into the Render field and submit.
    

## Automated Fixes

[Section titled “Automated Fixes”](#automated-fixes)

Once connected, Jules automatically monitors the Pull Requests **it creates** for build failures.

1.  **Jules creates a PR:** When you accept a plan, Jules opens a Pull Request with the changes.
2.  **Detection:** If the Render build for that PR fails, Jules automatically analyzes the logs.
3.  **Resolution:** Jules writes a fix and pushes a new commit to the same branch.
4.  **Merge:** You review the fix just like any other change and merge when ready.

Jules currently only monitors and fixes build failures on Pull Requests created by Jules. It does not automatically debug failures on PRs created by you or other team members.

# Repo view

The repo view gives you a focused workspace for interacting with a specific repository. From here, you can view task history, manage running tasks, and configure your environment.

## Accessing the repo view

[Section titled “Accessing the repo view”](#accessing-the-repo-view)

There are two ways to open a repo view:

1.  Click on any repository name from the sidebar task list
2.  Select a repo from the task picker, then click into it after starting a task

This opens a view scoped to that repository, including task history and available actions.

## Viewing tasks by repo

[Section titled “Viewing tasks by repo”](#viewing-tasks-by-repo)

Inside the repo view, you’ll see a list of all tasks associated with that repo:

*   **Running** tasks are listed at the top
*   **Completed** tasks include full logs and diffs
*   **Failed** or **waiting** tasks are clearly labeled

You can click on any task to reopen it, review the plan, or continue feedback.

## Starting a new task

[Section titled “Starting a new task”](#starting-a-new-task)

From the repo view, you can start a new task scoped to that repository:

*   Click **new tasks** in the top right corner
*   This will preselect the repo and branch
*   Enter your prompt and optimal setup script as usual

--- END OF FILE: review-plan-.md ---
--- START OF FILE: review-plan-.md ---

Source: https://jules.google/docs/review-plan/

# Reviewing plans & giving feedback

Once you start a task in Jules, it generates a **plan** before writing any code. This lets you know the direction Jules will take while it works on the task. From here, you can also iterate with Jules on the plan before any code is written.

## Reviewing the plan

[Section titled “Reviewing the plan”](#reviewing-the-plan)

After setup (cloning your repo, initializing the VM, and installing dependencies), Jules will present its plan.

You’ll see:

*   A natural language description of what Jules intends to direction
*   Step-by-step breakdowns
*   Any assumptions or setup steps

1.  Open each step by expanding them to read through each one.
2.  Give feedback using the chat input if you need.
3.  Click **approve plan** when you’re ready for Jules to begin executing and writing code.

**Note:** If you navigate away, Jules will eventually auto-approve the plan, which is set on a timer. So there is no need to babysit.

![Screenshot approve plan](/docs/_astro/plan.DIuDTol0_Z1SxJ1U.webp)

## Giving feedback

[Section titled “Giving feedback”](#giving-feedback)

At any point, you can use the chat box to talk to Jules.

*   Ask it to revise a step
*   Point out something it missed

# Running Tasks with Jules

Once you’ve logged in and connected GitHub, you’re ready to start coding with Jules. This guide walks through the key steps of running a task — from selecting a repo to writing your prompt and setting up notifications.

## Choose a repo and branch

[Section titled “Choose a repo and branch”](#choose-a-repo-and-branch)

Jules needs a repo and branch to work on. After logging in:

1.  Open the **repo selector** dropdown.
2.  Select the repository you’d like Jules to work on.
3.  Choose the branch you want to base your changes on.

Jules remembers your last-used repo, so you’ll always see the last used repo in the repo selector.

## Write a clear prompt

[Section titled “Write a clear prompt”](#write-a-clear-prompt)

Jules works best when your prompt is specific and scoped. Use plain language — no need for perfect grammar or code.

## Attach visual context

[Section titled “Attach visual context”](#attach-visual-context)

You can upload images when initiating a task in Jules. Visuals like UI mockups, front-end glitches, screenshots, diagrams, or inspiration help clarify context when used with your natural language prompt. How to use it:

1.  Drag-and-drop or browse to upload one or more images at task creation.
2.  Total upload size must stay under 5MB.
3.  Supported formats: PNG and JPEG.
4.  Images are only attachable during initial task setup; not yet available in follow-up prompts.

Jules ingests these visuals to inform its understanding and output. They wont be embedded in code or committed to your repository. If you want visual assets included in code, upload them to your repo separately.

**✅ Good prompts**

*   Add a loading spinner while `fetchUserProfile` runs
*   Fix the 500 error while submitting the feedback form
*   Document the `useCache hook with JSDoc`

**🚫 Avoid**

*   Fix everything
*   Optimize code
*   Make this better

If Jules needs more clarity, it will ask for feedback before writing code.

## Watching Jules work

[Section titled “Watching Jules work”](#watching-jules-work)

Once the plan is approved, Jules will start coding.

You will see:

*   An **activity feed** as each step completes
*   Inline explanations of each change
*   A **mini diff** preview for each file

Use the **diff editor** for a full view across all files.

## Final summary & branch creation

[Section titled “Final summary & branch creation”](#final-summary--branch-creation)

When Jules finishes a task, it provides a summary of everything it accomplished.

*   ✅ **Files changed**
*   ⏱ **Total runtime**
*   ➕ **Lines of code added/changed/removed**
*   🌿 **Option to create branch** and **commit message**

You can click **Create branch** to push the changes. Note that:

*   You are the branch owner
*   Jules appears as the commit author
*   You can open a PR from this branch in GitHub

![Screenshot done](/docs/_astro/done.TcJfaelI_22FvfH.webp)

## Giving feedback mid-task

[Section titled “Giving feedback mid-task”](#giving-feedback-mid-task)

You can send feedback to Jules while it’s working:

*   Type directly into the chat box
*   Ask Jules to change its approach, revise code, or clarify logic
*   Jules will respond and, if needed, replan or revise the task

You can intervene at any time, you’re in control.

## Pausing Jules

[Section titled “Pausing Jules”](#pausing-jules)

You can pause Jules at any time by clicking the **“pause”**.

When Jules is paused it won’t do any work, and will wait for your next set of instructions. You can prompt it again, unpause it, or delete the task.

## Starting tasks from GitHub Issues

[Section titled “Starting tasks from GitHub Issues”](#starting-tasks-from-github-issues)

You can start a task from a **GitHub issue** by applying the label “jules” (case insensitive). Make sure that the Jules GitHub app is authorized to access the repo.

Select an issue, then click the gear icon next to “Labels”. Then add the label “jules” (case insensitive) to the issue.

Soon, you will see Jules comment automatically on the issue. When Jules is finished with the issue, it will provide a link to the pull request where you can review its work.

# Scheduled Tasks

Jules allows you to set up recurring tasks ensuring continuous execution of routine codebase maintenance, monitoring, or updates without the need for manual re-prompting.

## Creating a Scheduled Task

[Section titled “Creating a Scheduled Task”](#creating-a-scheduled-task)

You can convert any standard task into a recurring one directly from the task input field.

1.  Navigate to the main **Task Input** field.
2.  Click the **Planning** dropdown located at the bottom right of the input area.
3.  Select **Scheduled Task** from the menu.
4.  Configure the **Frequency** and **Cadence** (e.g., Daily, Weekly) using the settings that appear at the top of the input field.
5.  Write your task prompt and click **Submit**.

![scheduled task](/docs/_astro/scheduled.AQyQ1slh_1DtfJI.webp)

The task is now active and will execute automatically at the specified times.

## Managing Scheduled Tasks

[Section titled “Managing Scheduled Tasks”](#managing-scheduled-tasks)

Once a task is created, you can view and manage it within your dashboard.

To find your tasks, look for the **Scheduled** tab located immediately **under the text field** in the dashboard. From this view, you can:

*   **Monitor Status**: See when the task last ran and when it is scheduled to run next.
*   **Delete**: Remove the scheduled task permanently.

Editing an existing scheduled task is not currently supported. You will need to delete the task and create a new one.

## Common Use Cases

[Section titled “Common Use Cases”](#common-use-cases)

Scheduled tasks are best used for maintenance jobs that require consistency but minimal human oversight. We’ve added three templated scheduled tasks that our friends at [Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) (Google’s AI Design tool) uses. They include:

Use Case

Description

**Performance**

A performance-obsessed agent who makes the codebase faster, one optimization at a time.

**Design**

UX-focused agent who adds small touches of delight and accessibility to the user interface.

**Security**

A security-focused agent who protects the codebase from vulnerabilities and security risks.

# Suggested Tasks

Jules can autonomously scan your codebase to identify areas for improvement and propose implementation plans. These are presented as **Suggested Tasks**.

Currently, this experimental feature focuses on identifying and resolving **#TODO** comments left in your code, with more capabilities coming soon.

## Enabling Suggested Tasks

[Section titled “Enabling Suggested Tasks”](#enabling-suggested-tasks)

To receive suggestions, you must explicitly enable “Proactivity” for each repository you want Jules to monitor.

1.  Navigate to the **Codebases** field in the left panel.
2.  Select the specific repository (codebase) you wish to activate.
3.  With the codebase selected, open the **Proactivity** tab in the left panel.
4.  Toggle **Proactivity** to **On**.

![suggested](/docs/_astro/suggested.CKs87OFo_Z3hhig.webp)

Once enabled, Jules will immediately begin scanning the codebase. After a few minutes, if a resolvable issue is found, a suggestion will appear for your review.

**Note:** At launch, you are only able to enable proactivity on up to 5 repositories.

## Reviewing and Running Suggestions

[Section titled “Reviewing and Running Suggestions”](#reviewing-and-running-suggestions)

When Jules identifies a potential task (such as a simple `#TODO`), it will surface a suggested fix. You will also recieve an email periodically when new tasks have been found.

1.  Review the suggestion card that appears in your dashboard.
2.  Click on the suggestion to see the context and the rationale.
3.  If you agree with the plan, click **Start** to have Jules start working on the task.

## Feedback and Dismissal

[Section titled “Feedback and Dismissal”](#feedback-and-dismissal)

You remain in control of your backlog. If a suggestion is not relevant or not a priority, you can dismiss a suggestion. Jules uses this feedback to better understand your preferences and improve future suggestions.

## Configuration & Limits

[Section titled “Configuration & Limits”](#configuration--limits)

*   **Scan Frequency**: Jules scans your repositories periodically to look for new suggestions.
*   **Repository Limit**: You can currently enable Suggested Tasks on up to **five repositories**.
*   **Current Scope**: The feature currently looks for **#TODO comments** that describe resolvable tasks.

# Managing tasks and repos

To start a new task:

1.  Click the Jules icon to return to the home screen and a blank prompt input
2.  Use the **+** button in the top navigation on the task view
3.  From within a specific repo view, click **new task**

You can launch multiple tasks at a time to run them simultaneously. If you are viewing an existing task, or repo page when you kick off a new task, that task will load and begin running in the background. You will have to navigate to the task to check for updates, approve the plan, etc.

Each task runs in its own virtual machine and maintains its own logs, environment setup, and code changes.

## Pausing or deleting tasks

[Section titled “Pausing or deleting tasks”](#pausing-or-deleting-tasks)

Sometimes you need to stop Jules mid-task or clean up old runs.

*   To **pause** a task: click the **pause**.
*   To **delete** a task: hover over the task in the repo view and click the **trash icon**.

> Paused tasks can be resumed later; deleted tasks are removed permanently.

![Pause Task](/docs/_astro/pause.CihHHess_Z1GL2IL.webp) ![Delete Task](/docs/_astro/delete1.Bxt2fzxA_bcJj.webp)

## Managing repositories

[Section titled “Managing repositories”](#managing-repositories)

Jules can only access repositories you explicitly allow through GitHub. In the future, Jules will work with more version control systems.

### Selecting a repo

[Section titled “Selecting a repo”](#selecting-a-repo)

If you’ve already granted Jules access to all your repos:

*   Use the dropdown when starting a task to choose any authorized repo
*   Enroll new from the left sidebar

## **Frequently Asked Questions**

[Section titled “Frequently Asked Questions”](#frequently-asked-questions)

**Why are paid plans only available for @gmail.com accounts right now?**

For our initial launch, we are launching in the Google AI Plans, which currently serves individual Google Accounts. We are working to quickly support other upgrade paths for users who have enterprise or Workspace accounts.

**Will the features and limits in these plans change over time?**

We may adjust limits and features as we learn how people are using the product. Our goal is to continue adding value, especially to the Pro and Ultra tiers, with differentiators like access to more advanced models, queue prioritization, more planned for the future.

**If my Google One plan is shared with my family, are my Jules task limits shared?**

For this launch, task limits are not shared or pooled. Each member of a shared family plan is treated as an individual user with their own set of task limits.

**What happens if I use all my tasks for the day?**

Once you reach your daily task limit (rolling 24 hour window), you will not be able to trigger new tasks until the limit resets. When you are at your limit, you may see calls to action within the product prompting you to upgrade to a higher plan.

**I have a Google AI plan, but I can’t access Jules. Why?**

Jules has a stricter age requirement than some Google One plans. To use Jules, you must be 18 years of age or older. Therefore, some members of a Google One plan who are under 18 may not have access to Jules benefits, even if the plan itself is active

**Can I still access my tasks when I hit a limit?**

When you hit a limit:

*   The **new task** button will be disabled
*   A tooltip or error message will explain the reason
*   You can continue reviewing or managing existing tasks
*   Task history and feedback are unaffected
