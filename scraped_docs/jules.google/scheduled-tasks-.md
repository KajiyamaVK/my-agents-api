# Scheduled Tasks

Jules allows you to set up recurring tasks ensuring continuous execution of routine codebase maintenance, monitoring, or updates without the need for manual re-prompting.

## Creating a Scheduled Task

[Section titled “Creating a Scheduled Task”](#creating-a-scheduled-task)

You can convert any standard task into a recurring one directly from the task input field.

1.  Navigate to the main **Task Input** field.
2.  Click the **Planning** dropdown located at the bottom right of the input area.
3.  Select **Scheduled Task** from the menu.
4.  Configure the **Frequency** and **Cadence** (e.g., Daily, Weekly) using the settings that appear at the top of the input field.
5.  Write your task prompt and click **Submit**.

The task is now active and will execute automatically at the specified times.

## Managing Scheduled Tasks

[Section titled “Managing Scheduled Tasks”](#managing-scheduled-tasks)

Once a task is created, you can view and manage it within your dashboard.

To find your tasks, look for the **Scheduled** tab located immediately **under the text field** in the dashboard. From this view, you can:

*   **Monitor Status**: See when the task last ran and when it is scheduled to run next.
*   **Delete**: Remove the scheduled task permanently.

Editing an existing scheduled task is not currently supported. You will need to delete the task and create a new one.

## Common Use Cases

[Section titled “Common Use Cases”](#common-use-cases)

Scheduled tasks are best used for maintenance jobs that require consistency but minimal human oversight. We’ve added three templated scheduled tasks that our friends at [Stitch](https://stitch.withgoogle.com/) (Google’s AI Design tool) uses. They include:

Use Case

Description

**Performance**

A performance-obsessed agent who makes the codebase faster, one optimization at a time.

**Design**

UX-focused agent who adds small touches of delight and accessibility to the user interface.

**Security**

A security-focused agent who protects the codebase from vulnerabilities and security risks.
