June 26, 2025

![Assign to Jules](/docs/_astro/assign-to-jules.DFMcEzUY_lXKPx.webp)

Add the label ‘jules’ to any GitHub issue to start a task in Jules. That’s it—label on, task live.

How to summon Jules:

*   Open a GitHub issue.
*   Click the gear next to “Labels”.
*   Add the label ‘jules.’

Make sure the Jules GitHub App has access to your repo. After that, Jules takes it from there. [Read more about running tasks in Jules](https://jules.google/docs/running-tasks/)!
