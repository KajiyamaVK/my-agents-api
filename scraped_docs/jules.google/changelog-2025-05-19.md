# Jules is here

Today, we’re launching [**Jules,**](https://jules.google.com) a new AI coding agent.

Jules helps you move faster by working autonomously on tasks in your GitHub repo. It can fix bugs, update dependencies, migrate code, and add new features.

Once you give Jules a task, it spins up a fresh dev environment in a VM, installs dependencies, writes tests, makes the changes, runs the tests, and opens a pull request. Jules shows its work as it makes progress, so you never have to guess what code it’s writing, or what it’s thinking.

**What Jules can do today**

*   Fix bugs with test verified patches
*   Handle version bumps and dependency upgrades
*   Perform scoped code transformations
*   Migrate code across languages or frameworks
*   Ship isolated, scoped, features
*   Open PRs with runnable code and test results

[Get started with the Jules documentation](/), and visit [jules.google.com](https://jules.google.com) to run your first Jules task.
