# Improving Stablity

May 22, 2025

We’ve been heads down improving stability and fixing bugs—big and small—to make Jules faster, smoother, and more reliable for you.

**Here’s what’s fixed:**

*   Upgraded our queuing system and added more compute to reduce wait times during peak usage
*   Publish Branch button is now part of the summary UI in the activity feed so it’s easier to find
*   Bug vixes for task status and mobile
