![Sample Prompts](/docs/_astro/changelog-015.CXL47v6I_ZPLQu4.webp)

To help new users get started with Jules, we’ve added sample prompts to the home page. These static prompts provide examples of how to use Jules and can be added to the text box with a single click.

Changes:

*   Sample prompts are now displayed on the home page for all users.
*   Clicking on a sample prompt will add the text of the prompt to the input box.
