# Feedback and support

Jules is in active development, and your feedback directly shapes what we build next. We want to hear from you whether you’ve found a bug, want to suggest an improvement, or have an idea for a feature.

## Giving feedback in the UI

[Section titled “Giving feedback in the UI”](#giving-feedback-in-the-ui)

You can send feedback directly from within Jules:

1.  Click the **feedback** button in top the navigation bar
2.  Select 👍 or 👎
3.  Fill out the short form and submit

Your feedback goes directly to the Google Labs team.

## What happens after you submit feedback

[Section titled “What happens after you submit feedback”](#what-happens-after-you-submit-feedback)

Your feedback is reviewed by the Jules product and engineering team regularly. We use it to:

*   Prioritize new features and fixes
*   Understand friction points in your workflow
*   Identify common patterns and corner cases

We won’t be able to reply to every submission, but we do read all of them.

## Feature requests

[Section titled “Feature requests”](#feature-requests)

Got something you’d love Jules to support? Tell us:

*   What you were trying to do
*   What got in your way
*   How you imagine it could work

Clear, real-world examples are especially helpful.

**Thank you** for helping us make Jules better.
