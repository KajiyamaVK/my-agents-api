# Image upload

September 9, 2025

![image upload](/docs/_astro/image-upload.CXDvQ88D_Z1J34qe.webp)

You can now upload images when creating a task in Jules. Use this to show frontend bugs, design inspiration, UI mocks, or any visual context you want Jules to consider while generating code.

For now:

*   Only JPEG and PNG formats are supported.
*   You can uplaod as many images as you want, as long as the total size is under 5MB.
*   Image upload is only supported at task creation (we’re working on enabling it for follow-up prompts soon).

Note: If your task involves using assets (e.g. logos) directly in code, those must still be committed to your GitHub repo.
